Participants are welcome to bring and use their own laptops with the software already installed (with a working Internet connection), to ensure that you can continue using what you learn once you leave the workshop. However, if you need, you can use one of the Library's training computers, a loan laptop, or a UQ-provided device, as they all offer the necessary software.

While **R** code can be written in various applications, we demonstrate the use of **RStudio**, a popular interface to write R code. *To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio*.

Please go through the installation steps below to install R and RStudio before the start of the workshop. Please also make sure that the software runs as expected once it is installed.

### UQ computers

If you have an ITS-managed computer, you can install R and RStudio from Company Portal

If you use a Library-managed computer, you can install RStudio in ZENworks (which automatically installs R too).

### Windows
