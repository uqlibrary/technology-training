# R & RStudio installation instructions

Participants are welcome to bring and use their own laptops with the software already installed (with a working Internet connection), to ensure that you can continue using what you learn once you leave the workshop. However, if you need, you can use one of the Library's training computers, as they all offer the necessary software.

## Install R and RStudio

For the workshop, we will use **RStudio**. RStudio is a handy interface to use the programming language **R**. *To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio*.
