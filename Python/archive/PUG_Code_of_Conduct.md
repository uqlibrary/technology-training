# UQ Python User Group Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
University of Queensland Python User Group community, 
as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are
committed to providing a **welcoming and inspiring community** for all and 
expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of 
conduct may be banned from the community.

Our Open Source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient.**

* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and
  supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not
  limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
  immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
  orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,
  political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
  and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
  making decisions. Although we are based in Australia, the UQ community is 
  extremely diverse, so you might not be communicating in someone else's 
  primary language.

* **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
  feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: Be kind to others. Do
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
  behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent
  threats or language directed against another person; Discriminatory jokes and
  language; Posting sexually explicit or violent material; Posting (or
  threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information
  (“doxing”); Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms;
  Unwelcome sexual attention; Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above
  behavior; Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
  stop, then stop.

* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity
  contributes to the strength of our community, which is composed of people
  from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
  perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
  viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to
  err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping
  to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.


### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate. We are committed to building a community
for all. At times, we might fail, but we actively attempt to treat everyone as 
fairly as possible. Whenever a participant or a host has made a mistake,
we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate
discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, or on
people's abilities and physical appearance.

We acknowledge the problem with the recent historical default in the scientific
computing community's makeup, i.e. usually dominated by white hetcis men. We 
consider that it is our responsibility to counter this self-sustaining 
dominance by actively encouraging diversity, and by making every effort to 
ensure participants that do not fit that recent historical default feel 
welcomed, supported and safe.

### Inclusivity Statement

As a community, we recognise that we have a diverse group of students, faculty, 
staff, and guests, and we embrace and value the diversity of all our members. 
It is our policy to be inclusive and mindful of this diversity in our 
interactions with others. Our members come from all walks of life and so do we.
We expect great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it 
is the right thing, but because it makes our community stronger.

>"Inclusion is about the actions we take each day. Think about specific 
conversations or situations, where you can be exposed to new ideas and 
perspectives, walk in someone else's shoes, or encourage those who might 
feel like outsiders to join a conversation. I bet you will discover 
something new about yourself and others too"
>
> – Terri Cooper, Chief Inclusion Officer.

We strive to make the collective sum of our individual differences, life 
experiences, knowledge, innovation, self-expression, and talent our *culture*. 

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting Kathleen Smeaton 
(k.smeaton<·at·>library.uq.edu.au) or Luke Gaiter 
(l.gaiter<·at·>library.uq.edu.au). All reports will be handled with discretion.
In your report please include:

- Your contact information.

- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
  occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
  available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please
  include a link.

- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the
incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to
how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response
team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint
originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a
different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests
for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
