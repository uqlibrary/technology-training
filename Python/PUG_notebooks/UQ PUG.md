# UQ PUG

Welcome to the UQ Python User Group's monthly gathering. Our next is on the 4th of July, feel free to add your questions in advance below.

We've recently migrated to this platform, HedgeDoc, since Noteable has shut down.

If you're interested in viewing one of our past gatherings, you can find them in our [archive](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/s/h32mfqig2).


## About us
### Who are we?

We are a **gathering for Python users of any proficiency**, to help each other solve problems, share resources and tips, discover new features and hang out as a friendly community.

### When do we meet?
- Every **first Thursday of the month** from **10:00 am** to 11:30am
- In-person at UQ Central Library 12-N109
- Find the next gathering on the <a href="https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training">UQ Library Training Page</a> and book in through StudentHub
- Contact us at <a href="training@library.uq.edu.au">training@library.uq.edu.au</a> for any questions or support
- Access this page: [bit.ly/uqpug](https://bit.ly/uqpug) (all lower case).

## How it works

Each month, we gather at UQ Central Library to help solve each other's problems and discover new features. We begin with a brief demonstration before diving into group discussion.

Bring along your python questions, problems, conundrums, opinions and victories to share with the group. We'll try our best to help you out!

We currently use HedgeDoc, a collaborative markdown editor, so you can share your code easily. You can access this very page by going to the short link here: [bit.ly/uqpug](https://bit.ly/uqpug). To add your questions, press the pencil in the top write corner and simply type them in!
