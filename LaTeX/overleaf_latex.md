# Overleaf: write and collaborate on LaTeX documents
UQ Library
2025-04-14

## Introduction

LaTeX is a markup language and software system that allows writing
beautiful documents. It is widely used in professional mathematics
writing in particular because of its powerful **mathematical formula
typesetting**, but it is also popular in other fields, including
philosophy, physics, economics, engineering and linguistics.

The strong point of LaTeX is that it allows you to create very
**consistent documents**, while concentrating on the contents and the
structure, rather than worry about the appearance. The style of the
document can then be changed independently of the contents.

To author today’s document, we use **Overleaf**: an online platform that
facilitates editing and collaborating on LaTeX documents.

### At UQ

The UQ community has access to Overleaf Professional accounts. The extra
features offered (when compared to free accounts) are:

- Unlimited collaborators
- Real-time track changes
- Full document history
- Advanced reference search
- Reference manager sync
- Dropbox integration
- Git and GitHub integration
- Priority support

To access your professional account, sign into Overleaf with your UQ
email address.

## New project

In Overleaf, creating a **project** will create a new space to store,
upload and edit files.

On the main page, once logged in:

- Click on “New Project”
- Select “Example Project”
- Give it a name and click “Create”

Overleaf will then take you to a new document called “main.tex”: the
source code is in the panel on the left, whereas the “compiled” document
is shown on the right.

## Overleaf interface

Apart from the source and PDF panels, Overleaf includes a left-hand
sidebar that shows the project files and the file outline (very useful
to jump from section to section).

The top-left “Menu” button reveals another sidebar with project options,
editor customisations and help links.

You can resize and hide the panels at you will to make editing the
document more comfortable.

## Editing

### Preamble

The top of the source code, before the `\begin{document}` tag, is called
the **Preamble**. This is where the settings and main metadata of the
document are stored. Overleaf automatically populated with some
defaults, but as we need more features to write our document, we
regularly go back to the preamble to add extra **packages** and modify
their settings.

The following table describes what the example document contains in its
preamble:

| Tag                           | What it does                       |
|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `\documentclass{article}`     | Set the document type              |
| `\usepackage[english]{babel}` | Set the document language          |
| `\usepackage[...]{geometry}`  | Set the page and margin sizes      |
| `\usepackage{amsmath}`        | Display options for math equations |
| `\usepackage{graphicx}`       | Include graphics                   |
| `\usepackage[...]{hyperref}`  | Include hyperlinks                 |
| `\title{Your Paper}`          | Document title                     |
| `\author{You}`                | Document author                    |

Make sure you update the title and author of the document. We might also
want to change the paper format to “a4paper” instead of “letterpaper”,
and add an extra `\date{...}` tag to fix the date.

### The tab key

Some of the most useful shortcuts in Overleaf are provided by the **tab
key**. It helps autocomplete your code: using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key,
you can autocomplete the name of a command from the dropdown list of
suggestions, and some values can also be autocompleted inside the curly
braces (for example, when using references to figures).

The same key also helps move outside of the curly braces.

### Compiling

After editing the document, you will have to **compile** the document to
see the results. This can be done with the green “Recompile” button, or
using the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>return</kbd> shortcut.

### Editing the contents

The **contents** of the document are in between the `\begin{document}`
and `\end{document}` tags.

You can switch between the “Source” editor, which shows you the LaTeX
code, and the “Rich Text” editor, which is more similar to visual text
editors we are used to, like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer –
although you will quickly find that the features of the Rich Text editor
are very limiting.

Try adding a new section to your document (with the “Insert Section
Heading” button), and styling it with the “Rich Text” mode. See what the
corresponding code looks like in the “Source” mode.

### Common tags

Here are a few common tags used in formatting the text:

| Tag                                     | What it defines             |
|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------------|
| `\textbf{bold text}`                    | **bold text**               |
| `\textit{italic text}`                  | *italic text*               |
| `\section{main sections}`               | main section titles         |
| `\subsection{second level sections}`    | second level section titles |
| `\subsubsection{second level sections}` | third level section titles  |

### Lists

Now, add a list to your article. The tag `itemize` is for unordered
lists, whereas `enumerate` is for numbered lists:

    Unordered list:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item teatree
        \item bottlebrush
        \item melaleuca
    \end{itemize}
    And numbered:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item apple
        \item rose
        \item peach
    \end{enumerate}

Which results in the following:

![Unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists, three items
each.](img/lists.png)

### Errors

In the “Source” editor, you will notice that you get some visual
feedback if your code is not valid. Try for example to misspell one of
the tags opening or closing your bullet list: the whole block is
highlighted in red, and you can get a hint of what the issue is by
hovering over the red mark in the margin. If you try to compile the
document, you will also see an error message in the Logs (next to the
“Recompile” button).

![When hovering over the margin’s red mark open a tooltip with an error
message: “unclosed \begin{itemize} found at
\end{list}”](img/syntax_error.png)

### Hyperlinks

To be able to add hyperlinks, you will need to add the `hyperref`
package at the top of your document, with this line:

    \usepackage{hyperref}

You’ll then be able to add external URLS like so:

    A URL shown as is:
        \url{https://www.overleaf.com/}; 
    Or some hyperlinked text:
        \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{The Overleaf website}

Which would result in this block of text:

![Same text as before, with first URL shown, and second URL as linked
text, both clickable.](img/hyperlink.png)

### Commenting the source

As you are editing the source that defines what the documents will look
like when compiled, it might be useful to include comments that are only
visible when looking at the source. It is also useful when collaborating
on a document, to make sure others can make sense of a syntax not
commonly used.

You can add a comment to your source by starting a line with `%`.

For example, to let others know what the `hyperref` package is for, you
could add at the top of the page:

    \usepackage{hyperref} % for including hyperlinks

### Graphics

To add **graphics** to a document, the `graphicx` is needed, which you
can add at the top of the document with:

    \usepackage{graphicx}

You will then be able to add graphics with:

    \includegraphics{example_figure.png}

In Overleaf, if you want to keep things tidy, you can upload images to a
dedicated directory. However, it will be easier to then declare that
directory as the default one for images, at the top of the document. For
example, if all the images are stored in an “images” directory, we
should add this to the top of the document:

    \graphicspath{ {images/} }

Try it now:

- Find and download a [Public Domain featured picture from Wikimedia
  Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Featured_Pictures_in_the_Public_Domain)
- Upload the picture to the “images” directory
- Add the picture to the document

This is the simplest form of adding graphics to the document, but we
often want to add other associated information (like a caption) and
modify placement options.

Overleaf makes it easy to add a code template for figures by adding the
opening tag `\begin{figure}` to the source code. You should
automatically end up with the following:

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{}
        \caption{Caption}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}

This allows us to specify:

- The horizontal position of the figure
- The width of the figure
- The name of the file
- The figure caption
- The label that will allow cross-referencing of the figure

Try to move your previous picture to this new block of code, adding a
caption and a label.

One important option that is missing from this template is the
**placement specifier**. It comes straight after the `\begin{figure}`
tag, in between square brackets. If it is not specified, the figure will
default to being placed at the top of the page. If you want to place the
figure where the code is located, you can use the `h` position, which
stands for “here”. Other placement options can be found in the .

About the placement of the figure: an important detail is that the
(lowercase) “h” option place the picture where it the code is (for
example when page breaks move a picture to the next page). To really
force the location of a figure relatively to the text, you can use the
(uppercase) “H” option, which requires the extra `float` package
(i.e. you need to add `\usepackage{float}` to your preamble).

Another important option is the \*\*width of the picture}. If a picture
is too large, it might not be displayed at all, simply giving you a
warning along the lines of “float too large”. The width of a figure can
be specified with the \`\includegraphics+ tag.

As an example, the following code:

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{J_D_Story_1966.jpg}
        \caption{J D Story Administration building, UQ St Lucia (1966, Public Domain)}
        \label{fig:JD}
    \end{figure}

Results in the following figure:

![Figure with caption below](img/figure.png)

Alternatively, you can insert a figure by using the “Insert Figure”
button in the toolbar, or by copy-pasting it into the document. This
opens a dialog that allows to choose the file’s name and location,
specify the width and turn caption and label on or off.

Because a label was used, we can now reference the figure itself and the
page it is on:

        \ref{fig:JD}     % reference the figure
        \pageref{fig:JD} % reference the page the figure is on

Overleaf will suggest figure labels when using these two tags, so you
can autocomplete your code.

The following code:

    See \ref{fig:JD} on page \pageref{fig:JD}.

Results in the following text:

![In-text referencing: figure and page numbers are
hyperlinks.](img/ref.png)

### Warnings

As you write the source code of your document, and compile it regularly,
you might see **warnings** pop up in the margin of the source panel. By
hovering the pointer over the icon, you should see extra information.

![A warning message about an “Overfull hbox”, revealed by hovering over
the warning icon in the source’s margin.](img/hbox_warning.png)

It is very common to see warnings about “overfull and underfull boxes”
(“hbox” or “vbox”). These warnings are issued by the TeX engine the
compile the document, and can usually be safely ignored. However, they
might sometime help you spot undesirable typesetting, (e.g. some text
overflowing to one side). Take note of them, but often won’t require you
to take any action. If you want to learn more about these warnings, see
the [Overleaf documentation about overfull and underfull
warnings](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Understanding_underfull_and_overfull_box_warnings).

All errors and warning are listed in the log view, which you can access
with the “Logs and output files” button next to the “Recompile” button.

### Equations

A lot of LaTeX’s power lies in its mathematical equation typesetting.
For example, the following code:

    \begin{equation} \label{eq:euler}
    e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0
    \end{equation}

    The beautiful equation \ref{eq:euler} is known as Euler's
    identity.

Will produce this output:

![Equation rendered centred on the page, tagged as “(1)” and referenced
in the paragraph below: “The beautiful equation 1 is known as Euler’s
identity.](img/equation.png)

Notice the use of labels for cross-reference, just like we used for
figures.

## Collaborating

You can share your document with the “Share” button at the top right of
your screen, using your collaborators’ email.

It is possible to give different rights to different collaborators: you
could decide that one person can edit the document, whereas another one
can only see it.

### Review and track changes

The “Review” button at the top of the screen will open a side panel
showing the **comments**. Select some text and add a comment to the
document you are collaborating on. Others can then reply to your
comment.

This panel is also where **tracked changes** can be turned on. Changes
will be shown in the same side panel as the comments. Collaborators can
then accept or reject changes.

### Chat

Finally, a **chat** feature is available in Overleaf. You can open it
with the top-right “Chat” button.

## History

You can see a **history** of versions by clicking the “History” button
in the top right.

Specific versions can also be **labelled**, which might be useful to
help navigate a complex history of versions, and direct collaborators to
where major changes have happened.

## Export and publish

To **export the document to PDF**, click on the “Download PDF” button
above the compiled view panel.

Overleaf integrates some guidance to **publish** on a selection of
platforms. You can see the publishers available by clicking on the
“Submit” button in the top toolbar.

To make sure you can keep working on your document outside of Overleaf,
or to submit the **source files** to a publisher, you will have to
download the whole project, not just the compiled PDF. To do that, open
the main menu (top right “Menu” button) and click on “Source”. You will
then be able to download a zip archive containing all your .tex files,
images, references files and others.

## Templates

Overleaf provides many **templates** to choose from, which makes it
easier to find a document style that looks right from the beginning and
not spend too much time on finding the right packages and changing
parameters in the preamble.

- Go to the main Overleaf page (up arrow button in the top toolbar)
- Click on “New Project”
- Choose from either:
  - Institution templates
  - One of the main templates listed
  - The full list of templates
- In the template’s description page, click “Open as template”

See for example the Beamer template offered in the UQ templates ([Beamer
documents](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) are used for
creating presentation slides). This particular template also
demonstrates the use of a LaTeX plotting package called `pgfplots`,
which you can learn more about on [Overleaf’s pgfplots
documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Pgfplots_package).

## Account integrations

Your Overleaf account can be integrated with a variety of other services
and platforms.

### Git and GitHub

**Git** is a version control tool widely used to record a project’s
history, notably for software development.

From a project, using the top-right Menu button, it is possible to:

- Clone the project repository to your own computer (and use Overleaf as
  a remote repository)
- Link the project to a GitHub repository

### ORCiD

[**ORCiD**](https://orcid.org/) is a unique identifier for researchers.
Linking your Overleaf account to your ORCiD will automatically use it
when submitting an article to publishers.

This option can be found in the account settings.

### Reference managers

Overleaf integrates **Zotero** and **Mendeley** to easily import
references into projects.

This option can be found in the account settings. You will then be able
to use the “From Zotero” or “From Mendeley” options in the “Upload”
dialog to import your library as a .bib file.

Once a .bib file is available in the project, it is possible to use the
`biblatex` package to cite references and create a bibliography. For
example, adding this to the preamble:

    \usepackage{biblatex}
    \addbibresource{references.bib}

And then referencing in the document:

    This section is sourced \cite{aguiar_invasion_2013}.
    This other section as well \cite{akkemik_archaeology_2012}.
    \section{Bibliography}
    \printbibliography

If you use EndNote, you should be able to export your library to a .bib
file by using the BibTeX export style, and then upload it to your
Overleaf project.

Many options are available to customise your citations and bibliography.
To learn more, see the [Overleaf documentation on
bibliographies](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_bibliographies_on_Overleaf).

## Accessibility

Unfortunately, it is not currently easy to create fully **accessible
PDFs** using LaTeX (i.e. tagged PDF, or following full PDF/UA
specifications). Some tools do exist to make the output more universally
accessible, including a tool called `make4ht` to create HTML instead of
PDF, and a package called `tagpdf` to explore the possibility of
creating tagged PDFs. However, they are still very experimental, and
only trying to patch a deeper issue in how PDFs are structured.

While there is [work
underway](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/605142/160963) to integrate
accessibility features in the underlying software, we are still a long
way away from having access to these improvements on Overleaf, and the
best that can be done for users is to style and structure our documents
for improved accessibility. Here are some recommendations to keep in
mind from the onset when working on any kind of document:

- Make sure all figures and tables are captioned, and that they are
  sufficiently described
- Do not include tables as pictures
- Avoid using text annotations, labels and titles inside pictures, and
  move that information to the main text
- If pictures contain text, it might be a better option to use vector
  graphics (like the SVG format) rather than raster graphics (PNG, JPG,
  etc.)
- Check the colours used throughout the document to make sure the
  contrast is sufficient, and the palettes are accessible to colourblind
  readers
- Give text descriptions to hyperlinks instead of only displaying the
  URL
- Keep the structure of the document simple
