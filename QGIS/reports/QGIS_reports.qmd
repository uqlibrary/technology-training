## Setting up

This is an intermediate level tutorial. Before completing this tutorial, we recommend our [QGIS: Introduction to Mapping](../intro/QGIS_intro.qmd) tutorial. This tutorial is designed for **QGIS 3.40**. If you need to install it on your computer, go to the [QGIS website](https://qgis.org/download/).

We will start a little bit differently today, as we're going to get straight into a project. The **data** and **project** for this session can be directly downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/uqlibrary/technology-training-assets/raw/refs/heads/master/QGIS/reports/report_data.zip). This highlights one of the big benefits of creating a good folder structure for your project – it's much easier to share!

Please extract the folder from the zip file.

As always we have our classic setup:

-   "**data**" - for all the data we will use to make our maps, split into:

    -   "**raw**" - raw data from your research or the internet

    -   "**processed**" - any data you've modified

-   "**output**" - for any maps or images we export

-   "**temp**" - this folder isn't necessary, but when you're playing around and testing, it can stop things getting messy.

<!-- -->

-   Finally, we have our .qgz project file named "**qgis_reports_map.qgz**" inside the "**qgis_reports**" folder (the highest level folder) so it's only looking down into folders for data, not back out.

Let's open our **qgis_reports_map.qgz** file and get started.

## Today's Learning Goals

Main aims:

-   Create a pretty map for output
-   Automate our map description
-   Use templates

If we have time:

-   Learn to use Web Mapping Services
-   Georeference an Image

## The Brief

We need to use our spatial files to make a map that:

-   Shows the project outline

-   Highlights the access paths

-   Categorises the artefacts

The current map in our project does accomplish these goals, but it's not inviting to look at.

To fix this, we need to ask some questions:

**Who is the intended audience for our map**?

-   A good looking map for a **Report** map may look different to an **Academic Paper** or a **Technical** map or to a map for the **Public**.

**What story am I trying to tell?**

-   Do you want to highlight a particular pattern in the data?

    -   You can use shapes and colour (esp. saturation) to bring your viewer to focus on certain elements of the map.

-   Does it need to look friendly or more professional?

    -   Your choice of a colour palette can bring cohesion to your map.

-   Do you have a lot of dense information you need to convey?

    -   Perhaps you need to make more than one map.

-   Do you need to show what the land surface looks like, or not?

    -   That brings us to our next question:

**What** **basemap does my map need**?

The basemap sets the tone for the rest of the layers in the map, as they can greatly change the visual complexity of the map.

-   Satellite image - Geographically informative, but visually busy

-   Street map - Geographically informative, but visually busy

-   Historical image - Informative and busy, but black and white imagery can be less visually busy

-   Simple topo map - Provides some information, but less visually busy

-   No basemap - Centres focus on data, but provides no geographic context

## Basemaps

Let's start by making a map we might use in a report where we need to see the land surface with satellite imagery. Unless we really need everything on the **OpenStreetMap**, it is too busy, and distracting. Let's load in a new basemap. There are many ways of doing this, in the past we've used the **QuickMapServices** plugin to load in new basemaps, now we can go to the next step and source them externally. We can do this with WMTS (Web Map Tile Service), WCS (Web Coverage Service), ArcGIS REST Servers, and XYZ Tiles.

Today we're going to use an XYZ Tile from ESRI.

-   Scroll down the `Browser` panel until your see **XYZ Tiles**
-   Right click XYZ Tiles and select `New Connection...`
    -   In `Name` type **ESRI World Imagery**
    -   In `URL` paste:\
        [https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}](https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x})
    -   Increase the Max. Zoom Level to 20
        -   This value depends on what is available from the given service in different parts of the world. Increasing that value beyond 20 for a map in Brisbane will show "Map data not yet available" when you zoom in very close.
    -   Click `OK`
-   In the `Browser` panel, expand `XYZ Tiles` and double click on `ESRI World Imagery`
-   Now do the same for this **Light Gray Basemap**, but set the Max. Zoom Level to 16:\
    [https://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Canvas/World_Light_Gray_Base/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}](https://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Canvas/World_Light_Gray_Base/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x})

Arrange the layers so that the **ESRI World Imagery** layer is under your other layers (you can hide the **Light Gray Basemap** and **OpenStreetMap** for now)

## Colours

The random colours that QGIS gives you aren't always pretty, so let's change the colours.

Choosing a colour palette can be difficult and overwhelming, but once you have one, you can keep using those colours to form a more harmonious looking map. What story are you telling? Do you want your map to be bright and saturated, or warm and earthy?

The built in color ramps provide some good options I quite like **`rainfall`** (in Precipitation), **`Set1`** (in QGIS), and **`wiki-knutux`** (in Topography).

Today we're being fancy, we're going to import and build our own Color Ramp and Color Palette.

-   In you internet browser, navigate to [colorbrewer2.org](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set2&n=8)

    -   Set Number of data classes to 8

    -   Choose Set2 (should be the second from the right)

    -   Click and drag to highlight the 8 HEX codes listed (they should look like this #66c2a5)

        -   Copy those with Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C)

-   Back in QGIS navigate to `Settings > Options...`

    -   Click the `Colors` from the left menu

    -   From the top right of the window click the `...` button and select `New Palette...`, name it **Report Palette**

    -   Add your copied colours by clicking![](mActionEditPaste.png) `Paste colors` on the right

    -   Click the `...` button again and tick the `Show in Color Buttons` box

    -   Click `OK`

We now have a custom palette we can use throughout our projects!

Unfortunately we need to set up the Color Ramp separately.\

-   Navigate to `Settings > Style Manager...`

    -   Click the ![](images/symbologyAdd.png) `Add item` button at the bottom and select `Color Presets...`

        -   Select the colour that appeared there and remove it by pressing ![](symbologyRemove.png) `Remove color` at the bottom

        -   Add your copied colours by clicking![](mActionEditPaste.png) `Paste colors`

        -   Click `OK`

    -   Change the `Destination` to **Default**

    -   Give it a meaningful `Name` like **Report Colour Ramp**

    -   Add the `Tag` **Palettes**

    -   Tick `Add to favourites` (this means it will appear in the color ramp dropdown, and not just in the All Color Ramps section)

    -   Click `Save`

-   Click `Close`

You can also use the `Style Manager` to edit the default options and Favorites that appear in the Layer Styling window.

Now we've set up our colours, we can start using them!

## Change the Symbology

### Point Geometry

#### Categories

-   Select the **Artefacts** layer from the `Layer Styling` panel
-   In the `Layer Styling` panel, change **`Single Symbol`** to `Categorized`
-   From `Value` select **Artefact Type**
-   From `Color ramp` choose our **Report Colour Ramp**
-   Click the **`Classify`** button

#### Symbols

If you want, you can change the properties of all symbols at once:

-   Simply click in the white space below your symbol classes so that none are selected.

-   If you click on the button next to `Symbol`, it will take you to `Symbol Settings`

    -   Try increasing the size of the symbols to 3mm

    -   Click `Simple Marker` and change the `Stroke color` from **Black** to **Dark Grey**

        -   This will retain that useful contrast while making it less harsh.

    -   **WARNING** if you edit any individual symbols before this step, it will reset any changes you made to those individual symbols.

-   Click the `back arrow button` next to **Symbol Settings**

Now that we have a nice colour scheme, let's give it a new shape. qg

-   Double click on the symbol of the `Artefact Scatter`
    -   Click **Simple Marker** - this will allow us to change many things including the shape of the marker
        -   From the bottom of the window select a shape, let's go with the **Triangle**
-   Click the `back arrow button` next to **Artefact Scatter**

### Polygon Geometry

Depending on your map, you may want your polygon to remain solid, to be transparent, have hatched lines, or simply be an outline. As our project area has items inside it, it is probably best suited as an outline.

-   Open the `Layer Styling` panel by pressing **F7** (or fn+F7)
-   Select the **Project_area** layer from either the `Layer Styling` panel, or the `Layers` panel.
-   Under `Fill`, click `Simple Fill`
    -   Change `Fill style` from **Solid** to **No Brush**
        -   Note that this is where you could add horizontal, diagonal, or many other styles as a fill.
    -   Click the dropdown next to `Stroke color`, and you should see `Report Palette` with all your colours, choose the **Yellow**
    -   Increase the `Stroke width` to 1mm

### Line Geometry

We can also make our lines stand out. Sometimes it can be as simple as picking a contrasting colour, and adding some more width. Sometimes it can be very useful to add some dashes to your line.

-   Select the **Paths** layer from the `Layer Styling` panel
-   Under `Line`, click `Simple Line`
    -   Change the `Color` to a colour in your Report Palette that is different to your points, I'm going to use orange
    -   Increase the `Stroke width` to 1mm - it looks big now, but will look better on your exported map later
    -   Click the **green +** next to `Line` to add another line symbol\
        (You can add as many simple lines, as you like, you can even change this with `Symbol layer type` to Arrows, Hashed lines, Filled lines, and more.)
        -   Increase the `Stroke width` to 1mm to match
        -   Tick `Use custom dash pattern`
        -   Click on the **dashed line** below the tick box\
            I like to set my **Dash** to 3mm and my **Space** to 5mm

## Themes

We can use themes to create multiple looks for our map that we can easily swap between. Let's create a map for our **Report Map**

-   Click the **Eye** icon (Manage Map Themes) at the top of the `Layers` panel, and click `Add theme...`
    -   Let's name our new theme **Report Main**, and click `OK`

Nothing exciting has happened *yet*, let's change the layers a little to see the power of Themes.

## Styles

**Styles** work similarly to **Themes**, but instead of changing which layers are layers present, it changes between different Layer Styling options.

If you want to try different looks for a feature, but not have to undo everything, you can save them as **Styles**

-   In the `Layers` panel, `Right click on Project_area > Styles > Rename Current...`
    -   Let's start by chaning the name of our current style from **default** to **Report Main**
-   Let's create a new style, `Right click on Project_area > Styles > Add...`
    -   Name the style **Report Inset**
        -   Now any Layer Style edits we do will be attached to the **Report Inset** style
-   Select the **Project_area** layer from the `Layer Styling` panel
    -   Under `Fill`, click `Simple Fill`
    -   Change `Symbol layer type` from **Simple Fill** to **Centroid Fill**
    -   Click **Simple Marker**
        -   Change the `Size` to 3
        -   Set the `Color` using your **Report Palette** to **Yellow**

Now we have a point as the centre of our polygon, we can edit this style and revert back to the original **Report Main** style whenever we like, we will explore how to use that with Themes next.

### Themes (again)

Now that we’ve made some style changes, we can see what themes do.

-   In the `Layers` panel, hide the **ESRI World Imagery**, **Paths** and **Artefacts** layers by unticking the boxes next to them.

-   Unhide the **Light Gray Basemap**

<!-- -->

-   Click the **Eye** icon (Manage Map Themes) at the top of the `Layers` panel, and click `Add theme...`
    -   Let's name our new theme **Report Inset**, and click `OK`
-   Now, click the **Eye** icon again
    -   You will see that there are two check box options at the bottom: **Report Inset** and **Report Main**
    -   You can cycle between these two themes by choosing one or the other
    -   If you want to update a theme, simply hide/unhide layers, change the layer Styles, go to `Eye icon > Replace theme...` and then select the theme you want to overwrite.
-   Save your project

## Layout Manager

Now we can prepare our map for export.

-   Navigate to `Project > Layout Manager...`
    -   Under **New from Template** click `Create`, name the map **Report Map**
-   This will open the **Layout Manager**

### Page Properties

Before we do anything, let's set up out environment.

-   Navigate to `Layout > Page Properties..`
    -   Here we can choose the size and orientation of our map.
    -   **Size:** A4 is sensible, as it means you know the map will fit neatly into a report.
    -   **Orientation:** Portrait means you can have a full page map without rotating the page in your report. But some spatial layouts make more sense in Landscape. Use your judgement.
        -   Today we will use **Portrait**

### Guides

Guides seem unnecessary, but they make lining things up, much much easier.

-   In the right menu, click `Guides`
-   Click ![](images/symbologyAdd-01.png) `Add new guide` under **Horizontal Guides** (if your canvas is a Landscape, choose **Vertical Guides** for this step)
-   A new row should appear, click on the **0** and change it to **235**

### Map

-   Add your map by clicking the map icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add Map`
    -   Your mouse will now be a **+**
    -   If you hover over the top corner of the canvas, the mouse should snap to the corner
    -   Click and drag until your mouse snaps to the corner created by the side of the canvas, and the guide you added
-   In the `Items` panel on the right, double click on **Map 1** and rename it **Main**
    -   Giving Items clear names makes this process much more straightforward

### Scale

Okay, we have our map, but it's not zoomed in right. This is always a little tricky.

You *could* click the **Move item content** button on the left menu(or press `C` on your keyboard), as this would allow you to drag the map around internally, and zoom in with your scroll wheel. **But there is an easier way!**

-   Navigate back to your **qgis_reports** window
    -   Right click on your **Project_area** layer and select **Zoom to Layer(s)**
-   Navigate back to your **Project Map** window
    -   In the right menu, click `Item Properties`
    -   You will see these options: ![](layoutmanager_scale.png)
    -   Click the first orange arrow button to **Set Map Extent to Match Main Canvas Extent**
    -   Click the third orange arrow button to **Set Map Scale to Match Main Canvas Scale**
        -   The other buttons do the reverse
    -   I like to then round the **Scale** up to a nice round number from something like 3814 to 4000

### Inset Map

You can add your inset map to the blank space at the bottom (or side) of you map canvas, or you can put it on top of you main map in unused space. However, we don't have an edge to snap our inset map on to, so guides are useful here too.

-   In the right menu, click `Guides`
    -   Click the **green +** under **Horizontal Guides**
        -   A new row should appear, click on the **0** and change it to **10**
    -   Click the **green +** under **Vertical Guides**
        -   A new row should appear, click on the **0** and change it to **10**

We don't need more guides unless you want a precise inset map size, but I'm happy so it's aligned evenly with the top and side border.

-   Add your map by clicking the map icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add Map`
    -   Hover over the corner created by your guides, the mouse should snap to the corner
        -   Click and drag until you're happy with the size of your inset window (without overlapping any important features on the main map)
-   Zoom out on the inset map, by selecting it from the `Items` tab and following the same approach as the **Main map**
    -   Or by using **Move item content** button on the left menu (or press `C` on your keyboard), clicking on the inset and using the scroll wheel
-   In the `Items` panel on the right, double click on **Map 2** and rename it **Inset**
-   Scroll to the bottom of the `Item Properties` panel and tick the `Frame` box
    -   This gives our inset a nice border which we can customise further

Now we have our maps added, we can bring our themes in to play again.

### Themes (again!)

-   Select **Main** from the `Items` panel
    -   In `Item Properties`, you will see **Layers** section
    -   Tick `Follow map theme` and from the dropdown change **none** to **Main**
    -   Now this map is linked to the **Main** theme and will only update when we change that theme, or the layers attributed to the theme
-   Repeat this step for **Inset**

This is also a big advantage for using **Styles**, as the point is a better representation of our site on the inset map.

### Title

-   Add a text box to your map by clicking the `Add Label` icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add Label`
-   Click and drag in the empty canvas below the map where you want to put your title
    -   In the `Item Properties` panel remove the **Lorem ipsum** text, and add **Brisbane Botanic Gardens**
    -   Under **Appearance** click the `Font` box to open the `Label Font` window
        -   Change the text size to 18, you can make other font changes here too
        -   Click the `back arrow button` next to `Label Font`
-   In the `Items` panel on the right, double click on **Brisbane Botanic Gardens** and rename it **Title**

Okay, that's a some fairly basic text, let's do something interesting with the descriptive text.

### Dynamic Text

-   Add another text box to your map by clicking the `Add Label` icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add Label`
    -   Click and drag in the empty canvas below the title
    -   In the `Items` panel on the right, double click on "**Lorem ipsum**" and rename it **Description**
        -   In the `Item Properties` panel remove the "**Lorem ipsum**" text and then enter:
            -   **Created by:**
            -   **Date:**
            -   **Scale: 1:**
            -   **Datum:**
            -   **Sources:**
            -   Normally we'd have to enter the details for each of these manually, but we can use **Dynamic Text** to do it for us
-   In the `Item Properties` panel, click next to **Date:**, so the cursor is sitting there
    -   Under the **Main Properties** text box, click `Dynamic Text > Current Date > Day/Month/Year (26/09/2025)`
    -   This will insert code that looks like this: `[%format_date(now(), 'dd/MM/yyyy')%]` which automatically adds today's date
-   Now repeat those steps for the rest:
    -   Click next to **Scale: 1:**
        -   Click `Dynamic Text > Map Properties > Main > Scale (4000)`
            -   The code will look like this: `[%format_number(item_variables('Main')['map_scale']` which automatically adds the main map's scale
    -   Click next to **Datum:**
        -   Click `Dynamic Text > Map Properties > Main > CRS Name (GDA2020 / MGA zone 56)`
            -   The code will look like this: `[%item_variables('Main')['map_crs_description']%]` which automatically adds the main map's CRS
    -   Click next to **Sources:**
        -   Click `Dynamic Text > Layer Credits`
            -   The code will look like this: `[%array_to_string(map_credits())%]` which automatically adds the sources built in to some of the data used
            -   Note that this is built into the Metadata (layer `Properties > Metadate > Access` under **Rights**) of the baselayers, and the layers we downloaded. Not all layers will necessarily have this information, and sometimes it's very detailed and clunky.

You could also add any extra text details such as the locality, disclaimers, or any other details needed.

### Shapes

We can add a border around our information section. This isn't necessary, but it looks nice!

-   Add a rectangle to your map by clicking the `Add Shape` icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add Shape > Add Rectangle`
    -   Hover over the corner created by the bottom of the map and the side of the canvas, the mouse should snap to the corner
    -   Click and drag until your mouse snaps to the opposite corner of the canvas
-   In the `Items` panel, click the box next to `Style`, this will take you to the `Symbol Settings` window
    -   Click **Simple Fill**
        -   Change `Symbol layer type` from **Simple Fill** to **Outline: Simple Line**
        -   Change the `Color` to a nice dark green
        -   Increase the `Stroke width` to 5mm
        -   Scroll to the bottom and tick the `Draw line only inside polygon` box

### Legend

-   Add a Legend your map by clicking the `Add Legend` icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add Legend`

The legend always has too much detail to start. Let's clean it up.

-   In the `Item Properties` panel, change the `Title` to **Legend**
-   Under **Legend Items** untick `Auto update`
    -   Click the drop down next to **Artefacts**, select the empty item, and then click the **red –** to remove it
    -   Remove the **Imagery** and the **OpenStreetMap** layer too
    -   Right click on **Artefacts** and select **Hidden**, we don't need to see the group name
    -   Double click on **Project_area** and rename it to **Project Area**
-   Scroll down to **Fonts and Text Formatting**, under **Legend Title** click the **Title font** button
    -   Change the `Size` to **13**
        -   You can change the **Item Labels** font size too, but **12** is fine here
-   Scroll down to **Spacing**
    -   Change **Legend Title** `Space below` to **2**
        -   You can change the **Legend Items** space between symbols too, but **2.5** is fine here

### North Arrow

-   Add a North Arrow your map by clicking the **Add North Arrow** icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add North Arrow`
    -   Click and drag in the blank space under the map until you're happy with the size of the arrow
    -   In the `Item Properties` panel, under the `SVG Images` box, type **arrow** in the search bar
        -   Choose a North arrow you like

### Scalebar

-   Add a scale bar to your map by clicking the **Add Scale Bar** icon in the left menu, or navigating `Add Item > Add Scale Bar`
    -   You can click and drag in the blank space under the map, although the scale bar size will be set in a moment
    -   In the `Item Properties` panel, choose the appropriate `Scalebar units` - usually **Metres** or **Kilometres**
        -   Under **Segments**, change the right `Segments` from **right 2** to **right 4**
        -   Change `Fixed width` to **50** units (on this map, I have used 50 metre intervals, as that feels understandable)

### Finessing

You will remember that we orignally made the points and lines quite large, but you will see that on this export map they are a more reasonable size. This is because we set them to millimetres, which will scale with our screen resolution when we zoom on the original map, but will scale to the size of our fixed dimensions A4 page in the `Layout Manager`.

Our point labels need to be resized too. Return to the `qgis_reports` window and try changing their font size to **12** in the `Labels` tab of the `Layer Styling` panel.

If the change doesn't flow through when you return to the `Layout Manager/Project Map` window, try clicking the refresh button in the top menu.

Move anything you need around to get it looking sharp. You could try using `Guides` if needed.

Save your project.

-   `Layout > Save Project`

### Export options

Now that we're done we can export. Generally to PDF or Image. Today we will use image.

-   `Layout > Export as Image...`
    -   You will see a popup warning about WMS servers. Some tile services have limits to the size of file you can export like this. If you exceed it, your basemap will be blank.
    -   Click `OK`
-   Navigate to your project's **output** folder, and give the file a meaningful name "**Brisbane Botanic Gardens Map**", click `Save`
-   The `Export resolution` should automatically be a print quality **300dpi**, and the width and height were set by our A4 selection.
-   Click `Save`
-   Navigate to and open your file to make sure it worked!

## Save a Map Template

This is crucial! Save your hardwork for next time!

-   `Layout > Save as Template...`
-   Navigate to a folder you can easily find again, such as a broader QGIS folder.
-   Give it a meaningful name "**Report_Map_Template**"
-   Click `Save`

## Load a Map Template

Next time you need to make an export you can load your template in.

Open an old QGIS Project.

-   Navigate to `Project > Layout Manager...`
    -   Under **New from Template** change `Empty Layout` to `Specific`, click the three dots and navigate to your **Report_Map_Template**, select it, and click `Open`
    -   Click `Create`
    -   Give the layout an appropriate name, and click `OK`
-   This will open the **Layout Manager**

You will see that the inset and main maps are in the wrong location, the title is wrong, the scale bar is off, and the Legend is empty. But you know how to fix these!

### Map Scale

-   Navigate back to your **QGIS** window
    -   Right click on the most suitable layer and select **Zoom to Layer(s)**
-   Navigate back to your **Layout Manager** window
    -   Click the **Main** from the `Item` panel, and click the `Item Properties` panel
    -   ![](layoutmanager_scale.png)
    -   Click the first orange arrow button to **Set Map Extent to Match Main Canvas Extent**
    -   Click the third orange arrow button to **Set Map Scale to Match Main Canvas Scale**
        -   The other buttons do the reverse
    -   Round the **Scale** up to a nice round number
-   Fix the inset map too

### Scalebar

-   Click the **Scalebar** from the `Item` panel

-   From here you can select from a wide array of images of QLD over many years.
-   Click one of the drop-downs and hover over the options to see where those images are located. Preview the image by clicking View.
-   You can then download your desired images by clicking "Download" and selecting TIFF (georeferenced)
-   Move the TIFF file(s) to your project folder, and open them in QGIS

You can also get historical images from Geoscience Australia's [Historical Aerial Photo (HAP) Collection](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/9a0ecbafe94f49829712b46fc69186ff)
