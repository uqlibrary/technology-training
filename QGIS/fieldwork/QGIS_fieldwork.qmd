# Setting up

This is an intermediate level tutorial. Before completing this tutorial, we recommend our [QGIS: Introduction to Mapping](QGIS/intro/QGIS_intro.qmd) tutorial. This tutorial is designed for **QGIS 3.40**. If you need to install it on your computer, go to the [QGIS website](https://qgis.org/download/).

We will start as always by creating a good folder structure to work within. This folder is where our project, our data, and creations will live. Folder structure is very important for keeping your data tidy, as well as for ease of sharing your project with others. You simply need to zip the project folder if you need to share the whole thing.

-   Open QGIS and create a **new project** with `Project > New`.

-   Let's now **save** our project: `Project > Save`.

-   Create a new folder, let's call it "qgis_fieldwork".

-   Inside that folder, create these folders:

    -   "data" - for all the data we will use to make our maps, split into:

        -   "raw" - raw data from your research or the internet

        -   "processed" - any data you've modified

    -   "output" - for any maps or images we export
    
    -   "DCIM" - this is a new one, it's for storing images from our phone!

    -   "temp" - this isn't *necessary*, but when you're playing around and testing, it stops things getting messy.

-   Finally, let's save our .qgz project file here, named "qgis_fieldwork_map.qgz"

Your .qgz file should always be in the highest level folder, so it's only looking down into folders for data, not back out.

This might seem necessary now, but things quickly get out of control and hard to find if you don't have a good folder structure.

Let's finally add an OpenStreetMap basemap to locate ourselves on the globe:

-   `Browser panel > XYZ Tiles > OpenStreetMap` (double-click, or drag and drop into the Layers panel).

## Install QField and Avenza Maps on your phone

QField and Avenza Maps are a mobile based offline mapping tools you can use on your smartphone.

### QField

QField plugs directly in to QGIS, and allows you to link a QGIS project with your mobile phone for data collection.

[Android Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.opengis.qfield) [iOS Download](https://apps.apple.com/app/qfield-for-qgis/id1531726814)

### Avenza

For Avenza Maps you just need to add a GeoPDF and you can collect data on it. It's less functional than QField, but it's a great fallback tool. [Android Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Avenza&hl=en_AU) [iOS Download](https://apps.apple.com/app/avenza-maps/id388424049)

There are alternatives out there, such as [Input (MerginMaps)](https://merginmaps.com/features).

# Get some data

We're going to explore a number of different online spatial data repositories.

### DEM

A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a common example of **raster data**, i.e. grid data that contains a value in each cell (a bit like the pixels in a coloured picture).

For this tutorial, we are using a DEM sourced from **ELVIS** - Geoscience Australia's ELeVation Information System.

-   Go to <http://www.ga.gov.au/elvis/>
-   Search for "St Lucia" in the `Location Search` search box and select the first result
-   Click `Order Data`
-   Choose "Draw" and "Box" and then click the `Draw` button
-   Click on the map to start drawing a rectangle around your desired area
-   Then click `Search`
-   The right panel will show you all the different datasets available in that area
-   We want the QLD Government Digital Elevation Model 1 Metre, click the down arrow on the right
-   As you hover over the different options, they will highlight a red box on the map, click the tick box and select all that overlap the area you're interested in (note that there may be data from different years here)
-   When you have the data you want, scroll to the bottom of the Order Data window
-   Select your industry, enter your email, tick the reCAPTCHA, and click the `Order Datasets` button
-   You should receive an email within 5 minutes, download the files from the link in the email, extract the folder to your project folder, and add them to your map.

### Aerial Imagery

There are a few places you can aquire aerial photography, today we will look at two sources, one is freely available Government Data, the other is accessible from using your UQ credentials.

As a UQ student, you also have access to very high resoltuion imagery from **NearMap**. You can even access an array of imagery going back in time.

-   Go to the [UQ NearMap Portal](https://admin.nearmap.com/invitation/domain-signup?token=q9WIbXMtna1iskb2meNGhKpCaQp3WTRbMhXpQVGWkKouKUeqzkpjNznC_Ogz5iKYiw0Ev7vym2Ykaj_W_V4dBbTzR6qUX2eTDsNHpBuR4XbU9vDRxQN_Rg==)
-   Enter your UQ Student (@student.uq.edu.au) or Staff (@uq.edu.au) email address, with the appropriate domain selected. Click "Invite me".
-   You should receive an email soon after, click the "Accept Invitation" button, and go through the account setup process.
-   Go to Login and enter your email address, click "Next" and enter your password.
-   From the top right select `MapBrowser`.
-   Type "St Lucia, QLD" in the search box, press enter
-   You can click the date down the bottom to look at different snapshots in time, and even compare maps side-by-side.
-   To save imagery from NearMap, simply click the "Exports" button on the left handside (it is an image icon)
-   From the menu that appears change the "Export type" to "Georeferenced image"
-   From "Projection" choose GDA2020 / MGA zone 56
-   You can increase and decrease the size of the bounding box by adjusting its corners, a smaller box means you can have a finer resolution, down to 0.075m. If we select all of UQ St Lucia in one go, the highest resolution we can have is 0.299m.
-   Once you're happy with your selection click `Download Files`
-   Move the downloaded zip file to your project folder, and open them in QGIS


If you want more aerial images or other spatial files, it's worth looking at a range of government sources. Your particular study area may have maps available such as the [Sunshine Coast MyMaps](https://scrc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=48501cb9e7294555be5b08e35e949616) service, CSIRO's [Norfolk Island Data Portal](https://data.csiro.au/collection/csiro:43016) or other [CSIRO spatial products](https://data.csiro.au/collections/search/SQDEM/STsearch-by-keyword/).

### Lot Plans

You can access a wide variety of QLD Government Data, including Spatial Data such as lot plans and vegetation maps, from QLD Spatial. There are three ways to access this data. You can download all of it, you can select a portion for download, or you can live load it into your project. Today we  download the files covering our project area.

-   To access data from QLD Spatial go to <https://qldspatial.information.qld.gov.au/>

-   Search for "property boundaries"

-   Scroll down to "Property boundaries Queensland" and click **Add to my list**

-   Click **My List** from the top menu

-   Click **View/extract in map**

-   Under Extractable Data, click the box next to **Property boundaries Queensland**, it will become green

-   Click **Extract/download**

-   Click **Choose an area**

-   Select **BRISBANE CITY** from the Select LGA option

-   Choose GeoPackage 1.0 from Select output format

-   Enter your Email Address

-   Accept the Terms and Conditions

-   Click **Extract/Download**

-   You can can also just download the preprepared data [here](https://github.com/uqlibrary/technology-training/blob/8e0aebe078198cd8bb65630c9ac4c4c8558a4392/QGIS/mobile/QGIS_Mobile_Data.zip), just press the three dots and download.

-   Move the downloaded zip file to your project raw data folder, and open the shapefile in QGIS

### Queensland Globe

Another way to access QSpatial Data is using the Queensland Globe portal.

-   To access data from Queensland Globe go to [https://qldglobe.information.qld.gov.au](https://qldglobe.information.qld.gov.au)
-   Accept the T&Cs.
-   Click **Search**, Select **Locality (Suburb) within a Local Government Area**, and search for the location you want and select it from the list.
-   Click **Layers**, click **Add Layers +** here you can scroll through and filter different layer types
-   We want to tick the box next to `Planning Cadastre > Land Parcels > Land Parcel` (you may need to zoom in to see certain layers)
-   To export data click the Wrench Icon in the top right, and then click the Identify icon (i)
-   Use the triangular Identify Polygon tool to select and area of interest. Double click when you've finished selecting your area.
-   The Layers menu will now show your selection. You can download all, or sections, of your selection.
-   I will choose **Land Parcel** and then **Download** as a **shp** file.
-   Note: You may need to disable other layers for this to work correctly. I needed to turn off the **Transportation** layer to prevent roads from being included in my selection.

# Import and process our data

If you have saved your data into your **data** folder within your project folder **qgis_mobile**, it should appear in Project Home. You can import it into your project's layers by double-clicking on the data there.

## Create a buffer to clip our data

We now want to only keep data that is relevant to the St Lucia campus. To achieve that, we need a mask to clip data.

We first need to select the lots that are relevant to us: - Use the "Select Feature by area or single click" (in the toolbar) - Click on the lots one by one (or draw a rectangle around them) with the Shift key pressed.

We can now create a buffer:

-   Go to `Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Buffer`

    -   There are many settings we can change to edit the shape of the buffer, but we will leave most of these as the defaults for now.

-   Choose "Brisbane_lot_plans" as the Input Layer, and tick the **Selected features only** box

-   We next want to choose distance that we want to create a buffer away from our vector.

    -   You'll note that the distance is currently in **degrees**. This is because the layer projection is EPSG:4283 GDA94, a geographic coordinate system. This might cause issues.

-   If you click Run. Your buffer won't look very good.

    -   We first need to convert our layer to a local projected coordinate system.
    
    
### Reproject Our Data


Let's reproject the layer for better results.

We have two options here. We can either reproject the whole layer as we did in the [previous workshop](https://uqlibrary.github.io/technology-training/QGIS/vector/QGIS_vector.html#reproject), OR we can export our selection and reproject it as we export. Let's do the latter.

-   With our desired area still selected, right click on the lot plan layer `Export > Save Selected Features As...`
-   Set the **Format** to `GeoPackage`
-   Click the three dots `...` next to the **File name** field, navigate to the project's **processed data** folder, and type in **UQ_lot_plan** and click `Save`
-   Set the CRS to `EPSG:7856 - GDA2020 / MGA zone 56`
-   Click `OK`

The new layer will look the same, but it now has a different projection.

### Buffer again

Let's create that buffer again.

-   Select the relevant lots
-   Go to `Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Buffer`
-   This time choose **UQ_lot_plan** as the Input Layer
-   You'll notice the distance is now in metres. For this instance, I want a larger buffer of 50m.
-   When you click `Run`, your buffer should be a good distance away from the original boundary.

### Dissolve Polygons

Now we can Dissolve those polygons together:

-   Go to `Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Dissolve`
-   Choose "Buffered" as the Input Layer.
-   Let's save this one to file, rather than a temporary file.
    -   Click "..." next to "\[Create Temporary Layer\]",
    -   Then "Save to file", and save it as **UQ Boundary** to your products folder.

> **Note** the Buffer tool has a "dissolve" option, but it's important to know that there are many tools available.

## Combine our DEMs

See the visible line between the raster tiles? That is because the separate raster files have different maximum and minimum values, so use different shades for different elevations. We have to **merge** them to make sure they use the same colour scale.

To do that, we use the `Raster > Miscellaneous > Merge...` tool to create one single layer from them.

-   First, select all DEM layers for the "Input layers"
-   Make sure the option "Place each input file into a separate band" is **unchecked**, as we want to end up with one single-band layer
-   Click "Run"

> You will need to have Saga installed for this to work.

We can now remove the original DEM raster files.

## Clip the DEM

We now use `Raster > Extraction > Clip Raster by Extent` to **focus on our area of interest**.

-   Next to "Clipping extent" click `... > Calculate from Layer > UQ_Boundary`

-   Scroll down to "Clipped (extent)" and click "..." next to \[Create Temporary Layer\]", then "Save to file", and save it as **UQ_DEM** to your project folder.

-   Click `Run`


Another way to clip would be to use Mask Layer, but I prefer Extent, as the file size is the same, but you get more interesting data.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
-   Make sure the virtual raster output DEM is selected in the Input layer

-   Navigate to `Raster > Extraction > Clip Raster by Mask Layer` 

-   Set the Mask Layer to "UQ_Boundary"

-   Click `Run`
::: 

If you don't save to file directly, remember two things:

-   **rename** your clipped layer so it is more descriptive than the generic "Clipped (extent)"
-   you are currently using a temporary, **scratch layer**. It will be discarded if you exit QGIS. It is very useful for temporary intermediate files, but it can be safer to save copies of your intermediate data while you work, just in case! You can right-click on the layer and use `Export > Save As..`

## Save your project

It's not essential at this stage, it's just a good reminder to save your work regularly so you don't lose things when things go wrong.

## Clip the Aerial Imagery

We can repeat the same process as above to clip the Aerial Imagery.

Now, clip the converted aerial imagery:

-   Go to `Raster > Extraction > Clip Raster by Extent`
-   Make sure St_Lucia_Aerial is selected in the Input layer
-   Set the Mask Layer to "UQ_Boundary"
-   You may need to define the Source and Target CRS to ensure that it all runs smoothly
-   Scroll down to "Clipped (mask)" and click "..." next to \[Create Temporary Layer\]", then "Save to file", and save it as **St_Lucia_Aerial_clipped** to your project folder.

We can now clean up our project by removing the original and intermediate layers we won't need.

## Change the symbology

We can style our DEM with a **terrain colour palette**:

-   double-click on the clipped DEM layer
-   go to the "Symbology" tab
-   change the Render type to "Singleband pseudocolor"
-   by default, it uses the min/max values, which is what we want
-   we can change the "Color ramp" to something more suitable with the drop-down menu and `Create new color ramp... > Catalog: cpt-city > Topography > Elevation`, for example.

## Add a hillshade

Adding a **hillshade** makes your visualisation of elevation more readable and visually pleasing by giving an artificial lighting look to your map.

-   Go to `Raster > Analysis > Hillshade...`.
-   Ensure the Input Layer is your clipped DEM "St_Lucia_DEM"
-   Scroll down to "Hillshade" and click "..." next to `Create Temporary Layer`, then "Save to file", and save it as **St_Lucia_DEM_Hillshade** to your project folder.
-   Click Run

## Create Contours

Adding a **contour** makes your elevation even more evident and can also be used to quickly show elevation on other layers

-   Go to `Raster > Extraction > Contour...`.
-   Ensure the Input Layer is your clipped DEM "St_Lucia_DEM"
-   For **Interval between contour lines**, the default is 10 m, which won't be greatly noticeable at UQ where the highest point is 25 m. However, the finer the contour lines, the longer it will take to process. I will choose 5 m.
-   Scroll down to "Contours" and click "..." next to \[Create Temporary Layer\]", then "Save to file", and save it as **St_Lucia_Contours_5m** to your project folder.
-   Click Run


## Create a new layer for our data collection

This is a very important step, as you cannot create new layers in QField, so we need this to record the data we collect.

-   Go to `Layer > Create Layer > New GeoPackage Layer...`
-   Click the three dots `...` next to the **Database** field, navigate to the project's **processed data** folder, and type in **fieldwork_data** and click `Save`
-   For `Geometry type` choose **MultiPoint**
-   Set the CRS to `EPSG:7844 - GDA2020`
-   Under **New Field** we will add our layer attributes:
-   Let's call the point name "Name"
    -   `Name`: **Name**
    -   `Type`: **Text (string)**
    -   Click `Add to Fields List`
-   Description
    -   `Name`: **Description**
    -   `Type`: **Text (string)**
    -   Click `Add to Fields List`
-   Date and Time
    -   `Name`: **DateTime**
    -   `Type`: **Date & Time**
    -   Click `Add to Fields List`
-   Latitude
    -   `Name`: **Lat**
    -   `Type`: **Decimal (double)**
    -   Click `Add to Fields List`
-   Longtitude
    -   `Name`: **Long**
    -   `Type`: **Decimal (double)**
    -   Click `Add to Fields List`
- Click `OK`

## Add another field
It would be nice to be able to take photos when we collect our data, let's add another field.

-   Double click on the new **fieldwork_data** layer
-   Click on the `Fields` tab
-   Click the yellow pencil button to **Toggle Editing Mode**
-   Click the now visible yellow **New field** button
    -   `Name`: **Photo**
    -   `Type`: **Text (string)**
    -   Click `OK`
-   Click the yellow pencil button to **Toggle Editing Mode**
-   Click `Save`
-   Click `OK`


## Prepare the Attributes Form

Now that we have a layer with all the desired fields, we can now edit the layer form to customise how things are entered.

-   Double click on the new **fieldwork_data** layer
-   Click on the `Attributes Form` tab
-   At the very top of the window, click `Autogenerate` and change it to `Drag and Drop Designer`

On the left you will see all of our Fields, we can drag and drop these into the `Form Layout` section - this section lays out how our form will look when we enter new data.

-   Drag and Drop the **Photo** Field to the `Form Layout` so that it is sitting above **DateTime**
-   Click **fid** and press the **red minus button** - we want to keep the field, but don't need to see this in our form
-   Click **Name**
    -   Under **Constraints** tick `Not Null` and `Enforce not null constraint`
    -   We don't need to change anything else for Name, we just want to make it mandatory
-   Click **Photo**
    -   Under **Widget Type** click `Text Edit` and change it to `Attachment`
    -   Under **Path** change `Default path` to *@project_home + '/DCIM'*
        -   Change `Absolute Path` to `Relative to Project Path`
    -   Tick **Use a hyperlink for document path (read-only)
    -   Under **Integrated Document Viewer** change **Type** from `No Content` to `Image`
    -   Click **DateTime**
        -   Under **General** untick `Editable` - we don't want to edit this field 
        -   Scroll to the bottom, under **Defaults** change the `Default value` to **$now**
        -   If this worked, there will be a date and time next to `Preview`
    -   Click **Lat**
        -   Under **General** untick `Editable` - we don't want to edit this field 
        -   Scroll to the bottom, under **Defaults** change the `Default value` to **$y**
        -   The `Preview` will show **NULL**, but that's okay, we don't have data yet  
    -   Click **Long**
        -   Under **General** untick `Editable` - we don't want to edit this field 
        -   Scroll to the bottom, under **Defaults** change the `Default value` to **$x**   
-   Click `OK`

We should now have a functional form, let's test it in QGIS before we send it to our phones


-   Click the yellow pencil button to **Toggle Editing** on
-   Click the green dots (or press Ctrl + .) to **Add Point Feature**
-   Click on the map to add a point
-   The **Name** should be mandatory, the **Description** editable, **Photo** have an add option, **DateTime** should have the current date and time, and **Lat** and **Long** should have numbers like "-27.494066205142065" and "153.0153703956312"
-   Click `Cancel`
-   Click the yellow pencil button to **Toggle Editing** off



We're ready to export our project to QField.

-   Navigate to `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...`
-   Search for "QField"
-   Click on **QField Sync**
-   Click `Install Plugin`
-   Once it has installed, click `Close`

You can now access the QField Sync Plugin through the menu.

-   Navigate to `Plugins > QFieldSync > Package for QField`
-   If you get a Message window popup, click `Next`
-   Give your project an appropriate title **qgis_fieldwork** 
-   Under **Packaged Project Filename** navigate to your **outputs** folder and create a new folder called **UQ_Fieldwork**, open that folder and click `Save`
-   Under **Advanced** untick `data` and `outputs`
-   Click `Create`

We now need to zip this folder and send it to our phone!

-   Navigate to your **Outputs** folder, right click on the **UQ_Fieldwork** folder and compress it to a zip file.
-   Send this file to your phone via email, cloud, or using a cable.

## Using QField

-   Open QField
-   Skip any popups
-   Tap `Open local file`
-   Tap the green plus button in the bottom right
-   Tap `Import project from ZIP`
-   Navigate to your zip file. In my case, I had to go to the top left menu, and tap on **Downloads**
-   The file should open in QField. You may need to tap on the outer folder, and then the **Project** itself.

You can now access your map.

-   Tap the menu in the top right to see your layers.
-   Tap the eye to hide or unhide layers
-   If you tap on a layer, and then tap the pencil icon in the bottom right, you can edit a layer.
-   Let's do this for our **data_collected** layer
-   Tap on the map on the right to return to the map, your cursor will now be a cross-hair
-   Navigate around and then press the green + button to add a point
-   Fill out the details, and then tap the tick in the top left. 
-   You've collected data!

To export your data back to QGIS, you can either copy the whole project folder in your phones storage back to your computer, or:

-   Go to the menu
-   Tap the folder with a cog on it
-   Tap the three dots next to your **data_collected.gpkg** file
-   Send it to your email
-   When you import it back into QGIS, you may need to correct its CRS back to EPSG: 7844


There's more to explore, such as the very very helpful [QFieldCloud](https://qfield.cloud/), and I encourage you to do so.

## Exporting to Avenza Maps


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

Click on `Show Layout Manager` in the toolbar or use `Project > Layout Manager`. `Create` a new layout called "Avenza". We can now see the Layout window.

Normally we would add many elements to our layout if we were exporting it for print such as the map, a legend, a scale bar, a north arrow...

In this case however, we are simply interested in our map. Let's add the map to the canvas:

-   Go to the Layout tab, scroll down to 'Resize Layout to Content', click 'Resize layout'
-   Before we export, let's turn off any layers we aren't using in QGIS to save space
-   Click the Refresh View button up the top
-   Now we are ready to export.
-   Go to 'Layout \> Export as PDF...' and save your map.
-   The 'PDF Export Options' window will open
-   Tick the 'Create Geospatial PDF (GeoPDF)' box
-   Click 'Save'

You can repeat this process with the DEM and Hillshade to export out another kind of map.

Now you simply need to export the pdf file(s) to your phone. You can email it, send it through the cloud, or transfer it using a cable.

When you first open Avenza Maps it will ask you to create an account, but you can import up to three maps without doing so, you can avoid creating an account by selecting the 'x' in the top right corner. \* Allow Avenza Maps to access your device location \* Select the orange '+' in the bottom right and select 'Download or import a map' \* Choose 'From Storage Locations' (if requested, give Avenza Maps the permissions to access your files) \* Do the same for the other map, if you created one. \* Once it has been imported, tap on the map. \* You can now move the map around with your finger, and pinching to zoom. \* Tapping the placemark icon in the bottom left will add a placemark in the middle of the crosshairs. \* Tapping the 3 dots in the bottom right will allow you to add GPS tracking and draw and measure distances.
